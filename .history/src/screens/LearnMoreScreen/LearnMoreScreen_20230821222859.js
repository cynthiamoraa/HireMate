        One of the key features of Hiremate is the eWallet system, which allows
        users to securely and efficiently manage their finances. Freelancers can
        easily receive payments for their work and withdraw their earnings to
        their bank accounts or other payment methods. Clients can deposit funds
        into their accounts and release payments to freelancers once the work is
        completed to their satisfaction

        rate their experience with one another. This ensures that both parties
        have a positive experience and can build long-term relationships.
